Included Prefabs:

🎯 How to Use
-------------
1. Drag and drop the `RainLayers.prefab` into your scene to get a full rainy weather effect with all layers.
2. Alternatively, use the individual rain layer prefabs (`Rain_Back`, `Rain_Middle`, `Rain_Front`) for more customized setups.
3. Add drop and splash prefabs (`Drop_1`, `Drop_2`, `Splash_1`, `Splash_2`) wherever you want to enhance the rain effect.
4. Adjust position, scale, animation speed, or sorting order on each prefab instance to fit your scene.

⚙️ Customization Tips
---------------------
- Change the Animator component’s speed on each prefab to speed up or slow down animations.
- Modify the Sprite Renderer’s sorting order to control draw order between layers and effects.
- Replace sprites or swap animations to create your own unique rain styles.
